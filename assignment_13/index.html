        Hello! My name is Madeline Stokes and I am an 18 year old web design student at Concordia University in Irvine.
        I have 2 years of exeprience in java script and am basically trained in CSS and HTML. I don't know what to write here
        but I am supposed to have two paragraphs which is insane. I like music a lot, it's so awesome. Stray kids is my favorite
        artist right now.
